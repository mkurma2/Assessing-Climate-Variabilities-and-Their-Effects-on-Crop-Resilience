# Assessing Climate Variabilities and Their Effects on Crop Resilience

## Overview

This project, "Assessing Climate Variabilities and Their Effects on Crop Resilience," is a data-driven analysis that explores the impact of climate variability on crop resilience. Leveraging Python, Random Forest Regression, K-Means Clustering, and Data Visualization techniques, we have conducted an in-depth examination of historical climate data spanning from 1958 to 2020.

## Key Objectives

- **Correlation Analysis:** Using historical climate data, we have established a correlation between rising CO2 levels and global warming. Our data visualization efforts effectively highlight the vulnerability of corn crops, emphasizing the urgent need for strategic climate action.

- **Disaster Predictions:** We have engineered a robust Random Forest model that achieved an impressive 87.66% accuracy rate in predicting climate-related disasters. This predictive capability can be instrumental in disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.

- **Climate Shift Analysis:** By applying K-Means Clustering, we have identified critical climate shifts that have a significant impact on crop yields. These findings provide valuable insights for agricultural planning and resilience strategies.

## Getting Started

To explore our analysis and findings, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone` to copy this repository to your local machine.

2. **Data Access:** Access the historical climate data (1958-2020) and the code used for analysis.

3. **Visualizations:** Review our data visualizations to gain insights into the correlation between rising CO2 levels, global warming, and crop vulnerability.

4. **Model Application:** Explore the Random Forest model's performance in predicting climate-related disasters.

Our project aims to shed light on the critical relationship between climate variability and crop resilience. We believe that data-driven insights can inform strategic actions for a more sustainable agricultural future. Thank you for your interest and support!
